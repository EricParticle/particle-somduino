# SoMduino
The SoMduino is an Arduino Uno form factor breakout board intended to work with either BSoM or MSoM Particle products. The intent is to have the carrier board mostly assembled by JLCPCB except for the Particle [power module](https://store.particle.io/products/particle-power-module-battery-with-headers) and [SoM](https://store.particle.io/products/m-series-lte-m1-2g-global-ethersim). It should contain all of the basic components necessary for the programming and using a Particle module.

## Overview
The SoMduino has the following features:
- USB Type C connector for programming
    - This development board cannot be powered via USB and will require either a LiPo battery or a DC barrel jack connection.
- ON / OFF switch
- Mode & Reset switches
- RGB LED indicator
- 5-17V DC barrel jack connector for battery charging and normal operation
- Qwiic connector for I2C expansion
- Charging indicator LED
- Arduino Uno form factor for Arduino shield compatibility
